## TODO:
- Add TLS support
- Update and similar methods take a find.Log type,
  so you can query by other fields than just `_id`
- Make sure everything works (yeah guys, don't use this yet)
- Try to remove the global state and bucket purger daemon
  from the RateLimit middleware (src/middleware/ratelimit)
